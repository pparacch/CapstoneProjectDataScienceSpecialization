The Challenge
========================================================

<h3>Developing a prediction model for next word</h3>

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain.

When someone, for example, types <b>"I went to the"</b> the application should <b>presents at least three options</b> for what the <b>next word might be</b> and it should be able to run as a mobile/ web app in a <b>responsive</b> way.

* The <b>challenge</b> is related to the <b>"Data Science Capstone" module</b> of the <b>Data Science Specialization</b> (Johns Hopkins University, Coursera)</div>


The Supporting Data
========================================================

The data to used for building the __predictive model__ is coming from the __[HC corpora](http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/
)__. The __corpora__ is a collection of 3 different __corpus__ (twitter, news and blogs) with the aim of getting a varied and comprehensive corpus of current use of the languages.

The __original corpora__, with focus only on the __english language__ (*en_US*), includes:

* 2.360.148 tweets
* 1.010.242 news
* 899.288 blogs
